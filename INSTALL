Assuming you have got a copy of Zen, then to set it up, create a
symbolic link called 'dojo' in the directory 'public/javascripts'
pointing to the top directory Dojo source release (Dojo Toolkit SDK).
(In the top directory of that release, there should be the directories
dojo/, dijit/, dojox/, and util/.)  The reference to 'dojo.js' in the
file 'public/index.html' should be valid after this setup.
